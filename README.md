## Background
Data about international development projects around the world is notoriously incomplete, incomprehensible, or inaccessible.  This makes it exceptionally difficult for busy and resource-strapped aid professionals to find answers to key strategic questions, like understanding the competitive landscape or exploring opportunities for collaboration and avoiding duplication of effort.  AidSight is a fully-functional platform that uses modern data science techniques to make the 600,000 aid activities reported to the International Aid Transparency Initiatives (IATI) understandable and digestible at a glance.  Weâ€™ve also created a first-of-its-kind scoring algorithm to summarize the underlying quality of the data itself so that users can validate the reliability of their search results. This allows aid professionals to focus less on navigating messy data and more on making the world a better place.
